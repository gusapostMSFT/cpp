Binary Numbers:

372 = 3 * 100 and 7 * 10 and 2 * 1

binary num = 1 0 1 1
index =      3 2 1 0
first number is multiplies by 1, second by 2, third by 4, fourth by 8
2^index

8*1 + 0*4 + 2*1 + 1*1 = 8 + 2 + 1 = 11



Computer memory:

visualize as boxes next to each other, where each box is a bit. I will use B for box/bit

BBBB	this is 4 bits
there are minimum and maximum values you can put in each bit

BBBBBBBB 	this is a byte, a byte has 8 bits


In c++ there are two types of memory: the stack and the heap.

The stack is memory associated with local variables and the addresses of functions.
	The stack is like a stack of plates.
	This is also why you can have a 'stack overflow' when you call a function too many times or create too many variables.

The heap is all the memory available to the computer.
	The new keyword allocates memory on the heap.
	if you have an array that can become too large, use the new keyword so you don't get a stack overflow.
