Binary Numbers:

372 = 3 * 100 and 7 * 10 and 2 * 1

binary num = 1 0 1 1
index =      3 2 1 0
first number is multiplies by 1, second by 2, third by 4, fourth by 8
2^index

8*1 + 0*4 + 2*1 + 1*1 = 8 + 2 + 1 = 11



Computer memory:

visualize as boxes next to each other, where each box is a bit. I will use B for box

BBBB	this is 4 bits
there are minimum and maximum values you can put in each bit

BBBBBBBB 	this is a byte, a byte has 8 bits
